# Allvis NOR API Documentation

Here you will find documentation for the Allvis NOR API. Currently
only a preliminary `v0` version of the API is available, which means
that it may change at any time. It is therefore recommended that you
keep an eye on this repository, e.g. by watching it on GitHub, to stay
up to date with any changes.
